We have wrote the code in the following way to operate andy:

You have to Say "Wake up" first so that it can go into listening mode.

1. It can send emails. 
2. It can read PDF.
3. It can send text on WhatsApp.
4. It can open command prompt, your favorite IDE, notepad etc.
5. It can play music.
6. It can do Wikipedia searches for you. 
7. It can open websites like Google, YouTube, etc., in a web browser.
8. It can give weather forecast.
9. It can give desktop reminders of your choice. 
10. It can have some basic conversation.

There are more functions in it you can check it while going through source code.

These are the following modules used in Andy:


SpeechRecognisation | PyAudio | pyttsx3 | pywhatkit | datetime | wikipedia | pyjokes | cv2 | cv2 tools | requests | smtplib | psutil | random 
| instaloader | PyAutoGUI | PyPDF2 | bs4 | PyQt5 | pywikihow
 | speed test | pytube | numpy | urllib | covid | phonenumbers | folium | opencage | pillow | Pywave | win32api | mscvrt


In the present ANDY GUI we cannot see the commands running but they are visible on the terminal, so I plan to bring up the commands to display on the GUI.
